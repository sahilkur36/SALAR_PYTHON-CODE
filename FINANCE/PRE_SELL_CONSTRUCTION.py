"""
We are going to build a 2000 square meter, four-story, concrete frame building in 18 months.
 The construction cost changes every month based on inflation and due to the lack of advance payment,
 you are planning to pre-sell. From which month should we start pre-selling the roll that will bring us
 the most profit. Think logically and give an example in Python as a professional in this field and solve it.
 Also consider uncertainties
