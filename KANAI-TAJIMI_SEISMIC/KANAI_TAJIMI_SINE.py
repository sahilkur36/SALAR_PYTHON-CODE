Generate ground acceleration using the Kanai-Tajimi model involves simulating a non-stationary stochastic process:

The Kanai-Tajimi model is a widely used approach to simulate the random ground acceleration experienced during an earthquake.
It models the ground acceleration as a filtered Gaussian process, where a white noise process (representing bedrock acceleration)
is filtered through a viscoelastic system that represents the soil layer. This model is particularly useful for analyzing structures
subjected to seismic events.

The classical Kanai-Tajimi model consists of a linear oscillator attached to the bedrock, which moves with an acceleration modeled
as a Gaussian white noise process. The model parameters, such as the damping ratio (Œ∂_g) and the natural frequency (œâ_g) of the soil
deposit, are calibrated based on historical earthquake data, including zero crossings and other statistical properties.

In advanced versions, such as the fractional Kanai-Tajimi model, the purely viscous element in the Kelvin-Voigt element (a spring in
parallel with a dashpot) is replaced with a springpot. This modification allows for a more accurate representation of the viscoelastic
behavior of the ground, ensuring that the number of zero crossings of the absolute acceleration at the free field remains finite.

The non-stationary nature of earthquake ground motion is typically accounted for by applying an envelope or shape function to the
stationary process. This adjusts the intensity of the ground motion over time, reflecting the way an actual earthquake's intensity
changes during the event.

This program implements the Kanai-Tajimi model to generate artificial earthquake records. It combines the stochastic ground motion
from the Kanai-Tajimi model with a deterministic increasing sinusoidal function to simulate more complex ground motion scenarios.
The resulting ground acceleration is saved to a text file and visualized using matplotlib.

The program also includes uncertainty modeling using probability distribution functions (PDFs) and the Monte-Carlo method to account
for variability in soil properties and ground motion intensity.
