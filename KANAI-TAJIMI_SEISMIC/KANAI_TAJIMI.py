Generate ground acceleration using the Kanai-Tajimi model involves simulating a non-stationary stochastic process:

Using the Kanai-Tajimi model involves simulating a non-stationary stochastic process to represent
earthquake ground motion. The Kanai-Tajimi model is a widely used approach to simulate the random ground acceleration
experienced during an earthquake. It is based on the concept of a filtered Gaussian process, where the ground acceleration
is modeled as a white noise process (acceleration at the bedrock) that is filtered through a viscoelastic system representing
the soil layer.

The classical Tajimi-Kanai model consists of a linear oscillator attached to the bedrock, which moves with an acceleration
modeled as a Gaussian white noise process. This model is often used for the analysis of structures subjected to earthquakes.
The parameters of the model, such as the damping ratio ( \zeta_g ) and the frequency ( \omega_g ) of the soil deposit,
are calibrated by observing zero crossings and other statistics of historical earthquakes1.

In more advanced versions, such as the fractional Tajimi-Kanai model, the purely viscous element in the Kelvin-Voigt element
(a spring in parallel with a dashpot) is replaced with a springpot, which exhibits behavior between purely elastic and purely
viscous. This modification allows for a more accurate representation of the viscoelastic behavior of the ground and ensures
that the number of zero crossings of the absolute acceleration at the free field remains finite1.

The non-stationary aspect of the process is typically accounted for by applying an envelope or shape function to the stationary
process, which adjusts the intensity of the ground motion over time, reflecting the way an actual earthquake‚Äôs intensity
changes2.
Overall, the Kanai-Tajimi model and its variations provide a mathematical framework to generate artificial earthquake records
that can be used for the design and analysis of structures to withstand seismic events.
