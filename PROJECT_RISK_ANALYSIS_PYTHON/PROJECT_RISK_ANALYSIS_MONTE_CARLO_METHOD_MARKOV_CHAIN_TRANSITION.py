#                                   IN THE NAME OF ALLAH                                #
#      PROJECT RISK ANALYSIS USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION: TIME AND COST MANAGEMENT     #
#      BASED ON UNCERTAINTY WITH BETA DISTRIBUTION AND MARKOV CHAIN TRANSITION MODELS.  #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# 
# THIS PYTHON CODE SIMULATES PROJECT RISK ANALYSIS USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS        #
# BASED ON A BETA PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION. THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF         #
# ACTIVITIES WITH TIME AND COST ESTIMATES, ALONG WITH DEPENDENCIES (PREDECESSORS).      #
# HERE'S A BREAKDOWN:                                                                   #
#                                                                                       #
# 1. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS: FOR EACH ACTIVITY, TIME AND COST ARE SIMULATED MULTIPLE   # 
#    TIMES BASED ON BETA DISTRIBUTIONS, GENERATING A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES         #
#    FOR EACH.                                                                          #
#                                                                                       #
# 2. TIME QUANTILES CALCULATION: AFTER RUNNING THE SIMULATIONS, THE 10TH, 25TH, 50TH,   #
#    75TH, AND 90TH PERCENTILES (QUANTILES) FOR EACH ACTIVITYâ€™S DURATION ARE CALCULATED.# 
#    THESE REPRESENT THE PROJECT COMPLETION TIME AT DIFFERENT CONFIDENCE LEVELS.        #
#                                                                                       #
# 3. GANTT CHART: FOR EACH QUANTILE (E.G., 10TH, 50TH), A GANTT CHART IS GENERATED TO   #
#    VISUALIZE THE PROJECT'S TIMELINE AND THE COMPLETION TIMES OF EACH ACTIVITY.        #
#                                                                                       #
# 4. TRANSITION MATRIX GENERATION: THE CODE ALSO SIMULATES A MARKOV CHAIN TO REPRESENT  #
#    TRANSITIONS BETWEEN ACTIVITIES. A TRANSITION MATRIX IS GENERATED BASED ON THE      #
#    TIME QUANTILES. ACTIVITIES THAT DEPEND ON OTHERS (SUCCESSORS) HAVE TRANSITION      #
#    PROBABILITIES DETERMINED BY THE SIMULATED TIMES FOR THOSE SUCCESSOR ACTIVITIES.    #
#    FOR ACTIVITIES WITH NO SUCCESSORS, SELF-LOOPS ARE ASSIGNED.                        #
#                                                                                       #
# 5. VISUALIZATION: THE CODE VISUALIZES THE TRANSITION MATRICES AS HEATMAPS AND ALSO    #
#    CREATES NETWORK GRAPHS TO SHOW THE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN ACTIVITIES AT EACH         #
#    QUANTILE. THE EDGE WEIGHTS IN THE NETWORK GRAPH REPRESENT THE PROBABILITY OF       #
#    TRANSITIONING FROM ONE ACTIVITY TO ANOTHER.                                        #
#                                                                                       #
# 6. THRESHOLD FOR VISUALIZATION: A THRESHOLD IS APPLIED WHEN PLOTTING THE TRANSITION   #
#    NETWORK TO REDUCE CLUTTER, ONLY SHOWING TRANSITIONS WITH PROBABILITIES ABOVE THE   #
#    THRESHOLD.                                                                         #
#                                                                                       #
# THIS PROCESS HELPS ASSESS RISKS RELATED TO BOTH TIME AND COST AND VISUALIZES          #
# HOW UNCERTAINTY AFFECTS THE PROJECT'S OVERALL PROGRESS AND DEPENDENCIES.              #
